# Automatically generated mapserver configuration file.
#
# This file provides configures mapserver so that it can 
# provide WMS and WCS services for data created using 
# virtual globe models. Each model has one configuration 
# file.
#
# The output attributes of the model which are reported in
# the model script are considered to be layers, each with
# a name and a timestamp. 
#
# IMPORTANT! Mapserver MUST be supplied with a CONFIGKEY
# variable which is replaced at runtime. This CONFIGKEY
# is used to select the right model configuration for which
# maps have been created.
#
# Model name:       {{model.name}}
# Model version:    {{model.identifier}}
#
# Reported output attributes:{% for layer in model.reporting %}
#   - {{layer}}{% endfor %}
