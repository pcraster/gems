Future ideas:

* Overhaul the parameter settings for models to allow for different types. Now it's only string, int or float, but a "point" type would also be nice. For point types the user can click-and-drag a map marker onto the map, and the location will be filled in the input box as a WKT point. Doing something like readparam("point_parameter") can then return a boolean pcraster map with a True value at the location of the point.
